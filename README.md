### Why this space exists

SCHEIBL+Partner works in Program Control, Budget Governance & Scientific Modeling.
This GitHub org is our **scratchpad**: side projects, experiment logs, reproducible notes—and the occasional idea that just wouldn’t fit anywhere else.
No fluff—just the artifacts that helped us move from **evidence to execution**. If any of it saves you time or sparks an idea, even better.
